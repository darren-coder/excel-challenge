Crowdfunding Summary Report

Campaigns that started in June and July had greater success by both percentage and volume. Included is an additional graph that shows
the percentage of success by month for the dataset.

The calculation of the mean and median both showed strong evidence that more backers equals greater success rate for the campaigns.
The median better summarizes the data because the variance is very large.

Campaigns that had a goal between $15,000 and $35,000 had a tremendous success rate, though there are much fewer of them in comparison.

An additional graph is included that shows the percentage of success by category.

Limitations

There are many different currencies used in this dataset which harms the accuracy of the monetary calculations.

The total number of campaigns by category varies quite a bit. Similar sample sizes of each category would give a more accurate
measure of the rate of success by category.
